Features
The Registration Form project includes the following features:

Form Validation: The form utilizes the Yup library for validation, ensuring that all fields are filled out correctly. Validation rules include email format, password complexity, and required fields.

Authorization: The form allows users to register and authorize themselves by creating an account. Upon successful registration, the user's information is stored and can be used for future authentication purposes.

Error Handling: The form displays meaningful error messages when validation fails or authorization encounters an issue. This helps users understand and correct any mistakes they may have made during registration.

Password Confirmation: The form requires users to confirm their password by entering it twice. This helps prevent typos or mistakes during password entry.

User Feedback: The form provides visual feedback to users, indicating successful registration or any encountered errors. This enhances the overall user experience by improving clarity and communication.

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Formik: A form library for React that helps with form state management and validation.
